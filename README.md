# About me
Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mayra Navarro. Currently Software Developer, Tech Leader at [WNB.rb](https://www.wnb-rb.dev/) and also a community organizer member of [Ruby Peru](https://ruby.pe/).

## Coding Experience
I learn about coding from [Codeable](https://github.com/codeableorg) an intensive bootcamp, where I learned backend programming with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and Frontend with Javascript, React, CSS, HTML, Redux.

As a software developer, I did my intership at Able.co. For our client [SimCase](https://simcase.io/), we built two projects on their educational game platform for Wharton University.

My first full-time job was for the presidential cabinet of PerÃº(Government of Peru), there I was able to develop for various projects focused on citizen service: [Complain book](https://reclamos.servicios.gob.pe/), [citizen Claims](https://denuncias.servicios.gob.pe/) and the unique digital platform of the Peruvian government - [gob.pe](https://www.gob.pe/) . Of which within three and six months I became the technical leader of the first two mentioned.

## Background
I have had the opportunity to work in multiple business models, from managing donations for international non-governmental organizations, large consumer goods companies, government organizations, storage and logistics management of medicines, wholesale distribution of basic necessities, educational platforms, even open source libraries.

From my first job as a Help Desk, at the [International Potato Center](https://cipotato.org/), I discovered how much I enjoy helping people with their problems, and having a customer service attitude. As a SAP Basis consultant, I learned the culture of working in service companies, managing roles and managing servers as a client. Working in more structured companies such as IBM, (in Managed Infrastructure Services), allowed me to work with large companies and solve their problems and requirements with a plus due to my experience in customer service and previous experiences. As Project Manager for [Salutare](https://www.salutare.com.pe/) I was involved in the project of: the platform for the admission and delivery of medicines to the patient in hospitals (Sigah). I was able to manage the administration of deliverables and their fulfillment, the agreements with the stakeholders and the management of the goals together with the legal area for the management of the contracts, as well as monitoring the use of medicines in several national hospitals.
